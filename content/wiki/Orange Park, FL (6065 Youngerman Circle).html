<h2>History</h2>

This location is located next to 3 hotels and a shopping plaza, and it was also a franchised location. On August 31st, 1987, Orange Park (Youngerman) was bought by Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc along with <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Jacksonville, FL (9820 Atlantic Blvd)" >}}">the Atlantic/Regency Plaza location</a>, and <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Pensacola, FL (7350 Plantation Rd)" >}}">Pensacola, FL (7350 Plantation Rd)</a>.
